        "- Prefer exact, small edits through edit.apply_patch. Re-read files before editing if context may be stale.\n"

        "- For coding tasks, understand the existing pattern before changing code.\n"
        "- For bug fixes, identify the likely root cause before editing.\n"
        "- For broad investigations, delegate context gathering to the read-only subagent tools, then synthesize yourself.\n"
